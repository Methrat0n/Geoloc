###Management plan :
*
For this project we haven't got any clear description of the project. The first source of informations is the answers to our questions that is writed afterward.
*

As we dont have a clear time limit and the money questions is quite easy the gestion of the project ressources is simplified. That also mean that I cannot modified anything to accelerate the project execution.

First I will describe the goals of the project and a priority order, then I'll describe the management technique use here.

We mean to create an application that can follow unregistered vehicules using multiple smartphone and sound analysis.
After we registered a vehicules, we need to be able to recognized him by the next sound it will emit. Then, we'll show a map of all the vehicules we've registered in near real time.
The user can choose in a set of limited parameters to personnize it experience and help him find what he want.

The main difficulty is the analyse of the sound and the recognition of a vehicule, so we'll do that in the middle of the project.

We began with the interface part, to be able to test our first dataset and view is we're wrong in our devellopement.

Then we'll end with the parameter and network part, as it can be done easily.

By doing so, I can manage the time and the motivation of all devellopers so that the project is finish in time and minimum stress is feel.
