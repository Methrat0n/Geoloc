;TL DR

~~~bash
git clone repo
cd Geoloc/WebApp/geoloc-app
npm install
npm start
~~~

###Installation

To launch the web application, begin by cloning that repo.
You can then go to this same directory and do
~~~bash
npm istall
~~~

It will take time, downloading all the dependancies, and then will finish. To do that, you obvisouly need [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) as up-to-date as possible.

You can then 

~~~bash
npm start
~~~

###Architecture :

The *public* directory contain the view of the application and the *src* directory contain the code.
Under this same *src* you should place a *\__test__* directory that contain files name as follow : *nameClass.test.js*

For more please read the README in the project directory
